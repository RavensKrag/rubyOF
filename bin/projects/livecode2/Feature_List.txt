Feature List
---

+ LiveCode: dynamic reloading of code
+ History: wrap any PORO and save state over time
+ roll back history with #step_back and go forward again with #step_forward
+ when viewing latest state, #step_forward calls #update to generate new state

+ must call #pause before initial call to #step_back (helps prevent accidents)

+ can write code to execute on certain turns (frames)
+ main execution pauses when there are no more turns
	BUGFIX: no extra turn after TurnCounter sends :finished signal


+ Have an constant MAIN_OBJ which allows access to the top-level object. This enables exploring top-level constants from anywhere in the programming environment.
	These constants are generally always globally accessible, but without access to the top-level object, they can not be enumerated. This just allows for easier REPL usage and code reflection.
